# AI/ML/DL Portfolio ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my **AI/ML/DL Portfolio** repository! This is a collection of specific, targeted projects that showcase my expertise and experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and deep learning. Each project here addresses a distinct problem, applying various techniques and tools across data science and AI to highlight both foundational and advanced skills.


## Projects

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each project in this portfolio:

1. **Loan Payment Analysis**
    A comparative analysis of machine learning vs. deep learning methods for predicting loan repayment probabilities.

2. **Dental Segment Anything**
    Utilizing Segment Anything for precise segmentation of dental radiology images, followed by classification to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

3. **Flights EDA**
    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a flights dataset to uncover insights on flight delays, cancellations, and patterns in airline performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

5. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **Description**: Predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using classification models.
   - **Techniques**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model tuning.
   - **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn.
